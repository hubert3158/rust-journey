# 🦀 Complete Rust Mastery Roadmap

> A fully structured, in-depth roadmap to becoming a systems-level Rust expert, ideal for Obsidian.

---

## 📘 Phase 1: Getting Started — _Rust Basics & Mental Model_

**Why this phase matters:**  
This phase sets the foundation. Rust's syntax looks familiar, but its _model_ is different. Skip this, and everything else feels painful.

**What you’ll learn:**

- Variables, mutability
- Scalar & compound types
- Functions, expressions
- `if`, loops, `match`
- Basic collections: Vec, tuple, array

**Teaches you:**

- Rust is expression-oriented
- Immutability by default helps safety

**Milestone:**  
Write a simple CLI calculator or guessing game.

---

## 🧪 Phase 2: Ownership, Borrowing & Lifetimes — _The Rust Mindshift_

**Why this phase matters:**  
Ownership is Rust’s core innovation. Mastering this means unlocking safe systems programming.

**What you’ll learn:**

- Move semantics, `Copy`, `Clone`
- Borrowing: `&T`, `&mut T`
- Lifetimes: `'a`, elision rules

**Teaches you:**

- How the compiler guarantees memory safety
- Understanding the “borrow checker”

**Milestone:**  
Write a file parser that borrows from a buffer.

---

## 🧱 Phase 3: Custom Data Types — _Modeling with Structs & Enums_

**Why this phase matters:**  
Rust isn't OOP. You model real-world logic using structs, enums, and pattern matching.

**What you’ll learn:**

- `struct`, tuple struct, newtype
- `enum`, nested types
- Pattern matching: `match`, `if let`, `while let`
- `Option`, `Result`

**Teaches you:**

- Business logic as type-safe models

**Milestone:**  
Build a text tokenizer or simple interpreter.

---

## 🔄 Phase 4: Traits & Generics — _Abstraction in Rust_

**Why this phase matters:**  
Rust’s trait system gives zero-cost abstraction — more powerful than traditional inheritance.

**What you’ll learn:**

- Traits, default methods
- Generic types, bounds
- Associated types
- Trait objects, `dyn Trait`

**Teaches you:**

- Reusable, performant abstractions

**Milestone:**  
Create a plugin system or trait-based data pipeline.

---

## 🛠️ Phase 5: Error Handling — _Fallible Logic the Right Way_

**Why this phase matters:**  
Rust has no exceptions. Handling errors robustly is idiomatic Rust.

**What you’ll learn:**

- `Result`, `Option`, `?`
- Combinators: `map`, `and_then`
- `thiserror`, `anyhow`, custom error types

**Teaches you:**

- Propagating errors safely and concisely

**Milestone:**  
Write a CSV or file parser with clean error handling.

---

## 🔍 Phase 6: Crates & Modules — _Scalable Project Architecture_

**Why this phase matters:**  
Good module hygiene makes large Rust apps maintainable.

**What you’ll learn:**

- `mod`, `use`, `pub`
- Crate layout, Cargo features
- Workspaces, dependencies

**Teaches you:**

- How to structure professional Rust codebases

**Milestone:**  
Split a multi-file crate and use a workspace.

---

## 📦 Phase 7: Standard Library & Collections

**Why this phase matters:**  
Mastering standard tools makes you more fluent, expressive, and efficient.

**What you’ll learn:**

- `Vec`, `HashMap`, `HashSet`
- String vs &str
- Iterators: `map`, `filter`, `fold`

**Teaches you:**

- Fluent, functional programming with zero-cost abstraction

**Milestone:**  
Build a word frequency counter or log parser.

---

## 🔒 Phase 8: Smart Pointers & Interior Mutability

**Why this phase matters:**  
Enables advanced memory management while keeping safety guarantees.

**What you’ll learn:**

- `Box`, `Rc`, `Arc`, `RefCell`
- Interior mutability, `Drop`, `Deref`

**Teaches you:**

- How to safely share or mutate data at runtime

**Milestone:**  
Implement a tree structure or shared cache.

---

## ⚙️ Phase 9: Concurrency and Parallelism

**Why this phase matters:**  
Concurrency is _safe_ in Rust. You can write multithreaded code without fear.

**What you’ll learn:**

- `std::thread`, `JoinHandle`
- Channels, `Arc<Mutex<T>>`
- `rayon`, thread pools

**Teaches you:**

- Data-safe parallel design patterns

**Milestone:**  
Write a multithreaded scraper or file walker.

---

## ⚡ Phase 10: Async Rust — _Non-Blocking IO_

**Why this phase matters:**  
Rust is async-first for modern workloads like servers and APIs.

**What you’ll learn:**

- `async`, `await`, `Future`
- `tokio`, `async-std`
- Async traits, runtime control

**Teaches you:**

- Event-loop based architecture

**Milestone:**  
Build an async REST client or chat server.

---

## 🧬 Phase 11: Macros & Metaprogramming

**Why this phase matters:**  
Macros make Rust expressive without runtime cost. It’s compile-time metaprogramming.

**What you’ll learn:**

- `macro_rules!`
- Procedural macros
- Attribute & derive macros

**Teaches you:**

- Abstraction without performance hit

**Milestone:**  
Build a `derive(Builder)` macro or DSL macro.

---

## 🧨 Phase 12: Unsafe & FFI — _Systems Programming Unleashed_

**Why this phase matters:**  
To write low-level or interface with C, you’ll need `unsafe`.

**What you’ll learn:**

- `unsafe` blocks
- Raw pointers
- `extern "C"` and FFI

**Teaches you:**

- How to safely escape the borrow checker

**Milestone:**  
Wrap a C lib or implement a custom allocator.

---

## 🔬 Phase 13: Testing, Tooling, Performance

**Why this phase matters:**  
Professional Rust means testable, optimized, measurable software.

**What you’ll learn:**

- Unit and integration tests
- Benchmarks with `criterion`
- Profiling: `perf`, `flamegraph`

**Teaches you:**

- Building robust and measurable software

**Milestone:**  
Benchmark and optimize a core algorithm.

---

## 🌐 Phase 14: Ecosystem Specialization — _Pick Your Path_

Choose a specialization:
| Track | Focus Area |
|-------|------------|
| 🧵 Systems | Embedded, OS, memory |
| 🌐 Backend | Web APIs, async |
| 🕹️ Game Dev | Bevy, ECS |
| 🌍 WASM | Leptos, Yew |
| 🧠 Tooling | Macros, LSPs |

---

**🧠 Tip:** Use `Rustlings`, `Exercism`, `Leetcode`, and real-world projects to reinforce each concept.
